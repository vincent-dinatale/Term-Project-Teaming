# **Term Project Proposal**
### ***1.	The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.***
Main idea of the project is to build a weather website that also gives playlist recommendations to the user based on their Spotify and the weather. Some of the topics explored in this project will be pulling data from two APIs (both of which are in JSON format), building the backend with Python code, utilizing Flask in the website development, and building the front end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve the user experience. One of the accomplishments from this project is really build a fully functional website that can show the current weather based on the user input and Spotify recommended playlists. I am interested in building a website from scratch and including logic in the background to build a dynamic website and building out the front end. The minimum viable product with be a functional weather website and a link to Spotify to search artists. The stretch goal is have the website have the weather based on the input of the user and have the user be suggested music playlist based on the weather in that specific area. 
### ***2.	Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.***
Individual learning goals is building a functional website calling APIs by the end of the semester. Additionally working a bit more hands on with Flask to build the website. I will be working on this project alone and am excited to build a project that can go into my portfolio. 
### 3.	***Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.***
In terms of the implementation plan I will first research free weather APIs that are in JSON format which will make it easier to implement. Then work on doing a bit more research on the Spotify API in terms of the type of data and how it might connect to the users existing Spotify account to give recommendations. I have already started some research on the Spotify API by looking on their website (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) on the types of data that I can grab from the API. The goal of the first part of implementation is focusing on the backend aspect of the website. Following the building on the back end, I will focus on utilizing Flask and building out the front end of the page. I have been working on a Python project in my other BOW class which brought in the idea of using Figma to help build out the front end of the code because of its ability to export in HTML and CSS. 
### ***4.	Project Schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.***
#### Week 1
Research and narrow down on a desired free weather API that’s in JSON format 
Research and understand the Spotify API’s data and how it might work on the website. 
#### Week 2
Start working on building out the backend code for the Weather aspect of the page utilizing the API and Flask.
#### Week 3
Work on implementing and adding the Spotify API onto the website in the backend. 
#### Week 4
Continue working on the backend and managing a way to generate playlists based on the user’s location weather. 
#### Week 5
Work on the front-end aspect of design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Figma
#### Week 6
Continue working on the front end and finalizing functionality and testing. 
### ***5.	Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.***
I will be working on this project alone and will be tracking the progress of my project in Notion to keep notes and tabs of the development of the website. 
### ***6.	Risks and Limitations: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?***
One of the most significant threats to my project’s success is in having the APIs to work correctly and grabbing the correct data. For example, making sure that the Spotify API is still working and able to function. Other potential areas of failure would include that the APIs are not able to function and Flask not working in connecting the front and back end of the website. 
### ***7.	Additional Course Content: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?***
Some of the topics that might be beneficial might include more work on web app development using Flask. Another aspect that might be beneficial is learning more about IO programming. In a general aspect just improving my Python knowledge and experience to improve my code.
