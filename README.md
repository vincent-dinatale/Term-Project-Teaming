# **Welcome to the Weather Plus Spotify Music Player**:

This web app is designed to find the weather of a major city and return a playlist based on the weather conditions such as temperature. 
This is a simple app, the orginal idea was also to utilize the Spotify API, yet there were some issues running the output with allowing the user to search/ be recommended a playlist. 
The Spotify.py file is an example of running the API and breaking down the responce data.
